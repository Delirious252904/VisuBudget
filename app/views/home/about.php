        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p class="lead">VisuBudget was born not in a boardroom, but at a kitchen table, surrounded by the beautiful chaos of a large, neurodivergent family.</p>
        
        <p>Hi, I'm Chris, the founder of VisuBudget. For years, my wife Bethany-Lee and I tried to use traditional budgeting apps to manage our family's finances. With six wonderful children (George, Emma-Lee, Connor, Charlotte-Isobel, Audrey-James, and little Tobias), and with many of us being either Autistic or having ADHD, we found that most budgeting tools just added to our stress. They were complex, rigid, and focused on shaming you for past spending rather than empowering you for the future.</p>
        
        <p>The constant mental math of "Can we afford this?" while juggling bills, school runs, and everything else was overwhelming. We knew there had to be a better, calmer way.</p>
        
        <h2>A Different Approach</h2>
        <p>We created VisuBudget to answer one simple question: <strong>"What's actually safe to spend right now?"</strong></p>
        
        <p>Our goal was to build a tool that works *with* our brains, not against them. A tool that provides instant clarity, reduces anxiety, and gives you back the mental energy to focus on what truly matters â€“ your family. By automatically looking ahead at your income and expenses, VisuBudget gives you a single, trustworthy number you can rely on, day in and day out.</p>

        <p>We're just getting started, and we're so glad to have you on this journey with us. Welcome to a clearer, calmer financial future.</p>
